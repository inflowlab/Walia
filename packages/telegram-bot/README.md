## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Is my data really secure?"
Yes! Your files are encrypted on your device before being sent anywhere. Even if someone intercepted the data, they couldn't read it without your private key.

### "What happens if Walia goes offline?"
Your files are stored on the decentralized Walrus network, not on our servers. Even if our service goes down, your files remain accessible through the Walrus network.

### "Can I share files with others?"
Yes! Walia includes access control features that let you securely share files with specific people. You decide who can access what.

### "What file types can I store?"
Any file type! Documents, photos, videos, archives, code files - if it's a file, Walia can store it securely.

### "How long are files stored?"
You choose the storage duration when you store files (measured in "epochs"). Longer storage costs more, but you have complete control.

### "Is there a file size limit?"
The Walrus network can handle large files, but there may be practical limits. The bot will let you know if a file is too large.
