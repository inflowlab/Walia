## 🗺️ Roadmap / TODO

- [ ] **Encryption Option Selector**  
  Allow users to choose between **Seal-encrypted** or **public/plain** file storage before uploading.

- [ ] **Storage Cost Optimization with Compression**  
  Analyze files and suggest compression to reduce storage fees.

- [ ] **SUI Name Service (SuiNS) Integration**  
  Share files using human-readable names instead of wallet addresses.

- [ ] **Multi-language Bot Interface**  
  Add support for additional languages for international users.

- [ ] **Integration with SUI Wallet Connect**  
  Simplify wallet interactions from within Telegram.

- [ ] **Audit Log for File Actions**  
  Display a private activity history for each user's files.

- [ ] **Timelock Encryption Support**  
  Use [HexCapsule](https://www.hexcapsule.com/about) protocol for data to be encrypted in such a way that it can only be decrypted after a specified period has elapsed. This method ensures that the encrypted information remains inaccessible until the predetermined time has passed, regardless of who possesses the encrypted data.

- [ ] **Scheduled File Release**  
  Schedule file availability based on time or epoch.

- [ ] **Time-Limited Access Sharing**  
  Temporarily share access, with automatic expiration.

- [ ] **WaliaToken Ecosystem Integration**  
  Use **WaliaToken** to pay for services, receive rewards, and enable premium features within the platform.
